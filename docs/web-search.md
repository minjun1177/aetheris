## Web Search

A single general search engine answers the *entity* in a query and drops the
term that matters. Asked for `ollama num_ctx meaning` it returns ollama.com, the
Windows download page, and install blogs - none of which contain `num_ctx`. The
old implementation passed those straight to the model, which then answered
confidently and wrongly.

`websearch.py` fixes that in three stages:

1. **Candidates from complementary sources**, run concurrently. A general web
   index is weak on code identifiers, so Stack Exchange and GitHub are queried
   for those and Wikipedia for concepts. Keyword APIs receive a distilled query
   (`ollama num_ctx meaning` becomes `ollama num_ctx`); web engines get the
   original. If a source fails or times out, the rest still return.
2. **The pages are read**, not just their snippets, and split into passages
   ranked by BM25 whose IDF comes from the candidate pool itself - so a term in
   every candidate scores near zero and a rare one dominates. No model, no
   corpus, no network.
3. **A relevance floor.** The query's discriminative terms - explicit
   identifiers, or the rarest term the pool exposes - must actually appear in a
   passage. If nothing clears it, the tool reports that the search found nothing
   and names the pages it rejected, instead of handing over the closest junk.

Everything is free and keyless. To make candidate generation fully local too,
run a [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) instance and point
`config.SEARXNG_URL` at it (e.g. `"http://localhost:8080"`); it is then used as
the primary source and the public ones stay as backup.

Tuning knobs live in `config.py`: `SEARCH_CANDIDATES`, `SEARCH_FETCH_PAGES`,
`SEARCH_PASSAGE_CHARS`, `SEARCH_RESULT_CHARS`, and the three timeouts.
